# Upstream Sync Ledger: f608673

## Status

**In progress.** This ledger is the durable state for this upstream sync. Do not
describe the sync as complete until every row in the acceptance matrix is marked
`verified` or an explicit user-approved exception is recorded here.

## Immutable scope

| Field | Value |

| Runtime-focused upstream paths | 105 |

## Rules for this ledger

1. The latest RU implementation is the baseline. Preserve LW behavior, not the
   previous LW implementation or old RU internals.
2. Every affected LW or `[lw]` call must record its old contract, new contract,
   migration, and regression test before it can become `verified`.
3. New LW logic belongs in `src/lw/`. A direct RU change is allowed only as a
   minimal `[lw]`-marked connection to that logic.
4. Tests must exercise current public APIs. A mock of a removed private API is
   invalid coverage.
5. A green full test run is evidence for rows with explicit coverage; it is not
   a blanket completion signal.

## Recorded incidents and completed repairs

| ID | Affected contract | Evidence | Migration | Tests | Commit | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I-01 | `CustomCharManager._find_character_id_by_name` was removed by RU character-manager refactor | Auto-combat stopped twice with `AttributeError` after the first support skill | `CombatExtMixin` now uses the public `get_all_characters()` snapshot and stable `char_id` | `TestTeamChangeCheck` verifies the private API is not called | `ad031e6` | verified |
| I-02 | `game_filters.isolate_cd_to_black` was renamed/removed | Static upstream-break scan found the stale fishing CD OCR reference | Use `isolate_text_to_black` | `test_fish_catching` executes the OCR branch and asserts the processor | `ad031e6` | verified |

## Shared-path acceptance matrix

Each group below expands to the named shared paths. Every group is `pending`
until the individual contracts and regression evidence are added below it.

| Group | Shared paths | Required audit | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agent contracts | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | Compare all shared LW/RU rules and record any mismatch | pending |
| Planner documentation | `docs/development/combat-planner.md` | Check changed planner APIs, examples, and associated tests | pending |
| Localization | 13 `i18n/*/LC_MESSAGES/ok.po` or `ok.mo` paths | Verify no LW-visible strings were lost and generated catalogs match sources | pending |
| Bootstrap and dependencies | `main.py`, `main_debug.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock` | Verify startup and dependency contract changes against LW initialization | pending |
| Character core | `src/char/BaseChar.py`, `Hotori.py`, `Nanally.py`, `Requiem.py`, `core/CharFactory.py`, `core/CharRegistry.py`, `custom/CustomCharDbMigrator.py` | Map character lifecycle, role registration, custom-character schema, and all LW callers | pending |
| Combat core | `src/combat/BaseCombatTask.py`, `planner/core.py`, `planner/types.py` | Map session lifecycle, planner action/result contracts, interrupt and team-reload behavior | pending |
| Runtime infrastructure | `src/config.py`, `src/globals.py`, `src/interaction/NTEInteraction.py` | Check registration, global lifecycle, interaction semantics, and LW connections | pending |
| LW layer | `src/lw/chars.py`, `combat_ext.py`, `dsd_farm_ext.py`, `nte_task_ext.py` | Reapply each required LW behavior on current RU public APIs; no stale private calls or dual paths | pending; I-01 is verified only |
| Tasks and mixins | `src/tasks/AnomalyTask.py`, `BaseNTETask.py`, `DSDFarmTask.py`, `DailyTask.py`, `daily/DailyRoutineTask.py`, `mixin/CharUIMixin.py` | Trace task lifecycle and each `[lw]` hook across changed RU contracts | pending |
| Regression suite | `TestCharImplDb.py`, `TestCombatPlanner.py`, `TestCombatSurvivalStatus.py`, `TestDailyCoffee.py`, `TestUseUltimateConfig.py`, `test_dsd_farm_recovery.py` | Remove obsolete mocks, prove current contracts and preserve LW results | pending |

## Post-merge changes requiring boundary audit

These changes were added after `f608673`; they do not close the upstream-sync
matrix and must themselves obey the LW/RU boundary before the ledger can close.

| Change | Files | Required action | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Account-aware daily summary and retry | `src/lw/daily_routine_ext.py`, `src/tasks/daily/DailyRoutineTask.py`, `src/tasks/daily/FurnitureTask.py`, `src/ui/DailyRoutineTab.py` | Move remaining daily-specific behavior behind `src/lw/` adapters or mark minimal RU connection points with `[lw]`; retain current tests | pending |
| Interface-break repair | `src/lw/combat_ext.py`, `src/lw/fish_catch_ext.py` | Keep I-01 and I-02 regression coverage during later migration work | verified |

## Required evidence before closure

- For each matrix row, record the exact RU contract change and each LW call site.
- Record the migration commit and the tests that fail without that migration.
- Run the relevant focused tests and the full unittest suite after the final row.
- Check the final diff for LW boundary violations and synchronise any shared
  `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` convention changes.
- Leave no `pending` row. If an item cannot be proven, retain `pending` and
  report the sync as incomplete.
